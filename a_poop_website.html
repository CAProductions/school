after being found the dog was chased over to the
rocket ship to try to get it to run away. Instead of
running away the dog jumped into the cockpit of 
the ship and started the engines. It was never seen again.<br>

This Rainbow dog and her cub were taken in 
by a cupple who were very supprised about there
color. That night when the cuople went to bed
they were waken up to the sounds of a machine being 
put together. They ignored it, thinking it was just a dream
but when they woke up the next morning the dogs were gone,
and the only thing left was a smell of rocket fuel.<br>

This Rainbow dog proved to researchers that
rainbow dogs love photoshoots, by jumping
right into frame with an adoring smile
just as a picture of qween elizabeth of england
was being taken, the dog was then chased out
of the photo shoot but came back later for seconds.<br>
